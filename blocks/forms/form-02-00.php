                                <h3>If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way</h3>
                                <p>Why not go out on a limb? That is where the fruit is. Change and growth take place when a person has risked himself, and dares to become involved in experimenting with his own life.</p><p>Until you try, you do not know what you cannot do. The rich substance of the Universe is yours to do with as you wish. Why settle for so little in life when you can have so much, just be daring to be different in your thinking.</p>
                                <h3>Act now</h3>
                                <p>You cannot cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water. Do not let yourself indulge in vain wishes. If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way. Some people have greatness thrust upon them. Very few have excellence thrust upon them.</p>
                                <p>Nothing of great value in life comes easily. It is by what we ourselves have done, and not by what others have done for us, that we shall be remembered in after ages. In times of stress, be bold and valiant. A man may fall many times but he will not be a failure until he says someone pushed him.</p>
